# Raspberry Pi - SSD1306 128x64 OLED Display - C Code

## Background
This project was an exercise in reinventing the wheel for the purpose of learning...
There are already a number of libraries that allow you to write to these little 128x64 OLED displays, but that would be too easy (and wouldn't teach us anything), so I decided to write my own.
